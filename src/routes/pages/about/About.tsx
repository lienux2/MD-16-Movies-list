                            <p>Hi. My name is Liene and I am developer of this project.</p>
                            <p>My journey in programming starting in 12th grade when one of lessons was Programming basics.
                                I really liked it, but sadly didnt go after that dream. Most certainly you will ask why and I can answer that.
                                I was unsure about myself and my knowledge so that lead into fear that no school will accept me. I know, I know...
                                But I did what I did and later went to work regular jobs mostly as customer service consultant.</p>
                            <p>I have had few jobs between finishing school and this moment but the last 2 years I am unemployed. In february I had chance to study for free as nail care specialist. That is what I did for a while. I did nails. Wanna see results?</p>

                            <p>But then I found Codelex. Thought for a moment and decided to finally go after long lost dream of becoming a programmer. And as much as I do enjoy doing nail care service, that can be as extra what I enjoy doing. ðŸ˜Š</p>
